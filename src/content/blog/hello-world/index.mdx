![Hello World](./hello-world.svg)

In 2019 I deleted what remained of my social media accounts, and as of writing in 2024, that still holds true. You could argue that my live feed doom scrolling was replaced with a perpetual rotation between BBC News, Hacker News, and a sprinkling of X here or there, but my consumption of content on Hacker News in particular has taught me something. It's taught me that it's become incredibly easy and cheap (free in some cases), to have a slice of the internet to call your own.

One article in particular titled [Cool Things People Do With Their Blogs](https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/04/cool-things-people-do-with-their-blogs/) hit my reading list recently and it contained perfect showcases on the kind of weirdness that I wanted to capture in a blog. Although I did in fact already have a blog of my own published using hugo, with a tweaked version of the [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme, it felt stale.

In particular, the blogs that caught my interest was [Henrique Dias](https://hacdias.com/) where he catalogued things in his everyday that existed beyond the computer, like his photography and trips.

But also [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com/) who might be one of the few people whose sleep schedules are publicly available.

I was committed to the [Astro cactus theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-cactus/) after reading [George Spanos' Blog](https://gspanos.tech/), but decided that the monospace layout would be another design choice that could stifle future creativity. [Chris Nicholas's](https://chrisnicholas.dev) new blog's simplicity and my ongoing obsession with [shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) landed me here with the [Astro-nomy](https://github.com/mickasmt/astro-nomy) project.

I don't yet know what I'll write about, but hopefully it'll be a good outlet for me, and interesting reading for a few others.

**Edit (December 2025):** I've since moved to the [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) theme, which provides a cleaner foundation while maintaining the simplicity and shadcn/ui components I loved about Astro-nomy.
